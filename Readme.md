### FAQ

1. **What character does FalconBot play?**

    Falcon, of course!

2. **Does SmashBot work with Slippi?**

    It does! To run SmashBot, you can just use your regular Slippi Dolphin install.

3. **What's different from smashbot?**
    
    Well, I cooked up a few new chains and implemented the punish game completely differently

4. **Can I actually play against it?**
    Yes, but it's not programmed to throw out any moves ever. Unless you attack it all it does is dash dance on your current position. 
    He also only plays vs Marth on FD
